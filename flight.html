								<h5>Understand:</h5> 
								<p>Through a series of interviews, I was able to gather information about the clients needs.</p>

								<h5>Research:</h5> 
								<!-- <p>The second stage led me to look into the "true crime" genre and what other podcasts were doing with their logos.</p> -->

								<h5>Sketch:</h5> 
								<!-- <p>The third stage was sketching out several directions and imagery that could be used to represent the podcast. </p> -->

								<h5>Design:</h5> 
								<!-- <p>After many sketch interactions, I was able to narrow in on what PTB was liking at a potential logo.</p> -->

								<h5>Implement:</h5> 
								<!-- <p>After putting the final design into Adobe Illustrator we went back and forth several times between these next two stages. I would send over a version and then wait for feedback for changes.</p> -->

								<h5>Evaluate:</h5> 
								<!-- <p>Finally the logo was ready to be placed on their website. </p> -->

									<h5>User Research</h5> 
									<p>User 1: This user wants to compare prices to a set of personal criteria and weigh the cost to any given flight option. </p>
									<p>User 2: This user wants to get the best price for their specific personal criteria.</p>
									<p>User 3: This user wants to get a good price for their flight while getting an experience that is easy to understand.</p>
									
									<h5>User Goal</h5> 
									<p>My intended user wants a simple to read interface that allows them to compare prices to specific personal criteria. </p>
