                                This Logo was designed for the true crime podcast called "Plead the Belly". This podcast explores the nuances of women in crime.

                            <!-- <h5> <strong>Understand:</strong> The first step was getting to know needs and wants of PTB. I needed to not only meet their specific requests but get into what inspired their podcast, and what stories they were going to tell as to create a better and more useable design. </h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Research:</strong> The second stage led me to look into the "true crime" genre and what other podcasts were doing with their logos.  </h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Sketch:</strong> The third stage was sketching out several directions and imagery that could be used to represent the podcast. </h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Design:</strong> After many sketch interactions, I was able to narrow in on what PTB was liking at a potential logo.</h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Implement:</strong> After putting the final design into Adobe Illustrator we went back and forth several times between these next two stages. I would send over a version and then wait for feedback for changes.</h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Evaluate:</strong> Finally the logo was ready to be placed on their website. </h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Notes on Process:</strong> While the final result above is what was used, there were many stops along the way. I have included several of the many logo iterations that we went through.</h5> -->
