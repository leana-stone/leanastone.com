                                This Logo was designed for the true crime podcast called "Plead the Belly". This podcast explores the nuances of women in crime.

                            <h5> <strong>Understand:</strong> The first was getting to know needs and wants of PTB. I needed to not only meet their needs but get into their heads as to what inspired their pordcast, what stories they were going to tell, and who they were expecting to be their clients. </h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Research:</strong> Thge second stage led me to look into the "truecrime" genre and what other posdacsts were doing with their logos. </h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Sketch:</strong> The third stage was sketching out several directions and imagery that could be uised to represent the podcast. </h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Design:</strong> After many sketch interations, I was able to narrow in on what PTB was liking at a potential logo.</h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Implement:</strong> After putting the final design into Adobe Illustrator we went back and forth several times between these next two stages. I would send over a version and then wait for feedback for changes.</h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Evaluate:</strong> Finally the logo was ready to be placed on their website. </h5>
                            <h5> <strong>Notes on Process:</strong> While the final result above is what was used, there were many stops along the way. I have included several of the many logo iterations that we went through.</h5>
