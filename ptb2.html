                                    <h5>Understand:</h5> 
                                    <p>The first step was getting to know needs and wants of PTB. I needed to not only meet their specific requests but get into what inspired their podcast, and what stories they were going to tell as to create a better and more useable design.</p>
    
                                    <h5>Research:</h5> 
                                    <p>The second stage led me to look into the "true crime" genre and what other podcasts were doing with their logos.</p>
    
                                    <h5>Sketch:</h5> 
                                    <p>The third stage was sketching out several directions and imagery that could be used to represent the podcast. </p>
    
                                    <h5>Design:</h5> 
                                    <p>After many sketch interactions, I was able to narrow in on what PTB was liking at a potential logo.</p>
    
                                    <h5>Implement:</h5> 
                                    <p>After putting the final design into Adobe Illustrator we went back and forth several times between these next two stages. I would send over a version and then wait for feedback for changes.</p>
    
                                    <h5>Evaluate:</h5> 
                                    <p>Finally the logo was ready to be placed on their website. </p>
                            </div>
                        </li>

                                            While the final result above is what was used, there were many stops along the way. I have included several of the many logo iterations that we went through.
